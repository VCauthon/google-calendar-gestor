1. Authentication command: This command allows the user to authenticate with the Google API using their credentials.

2. List calendars command: This command lists all the calendars available in the user's account.

3. Create event command: This command allows the user to create a new event on a specified calendar.

4. List events command: This command lists all the events on a specified calendar.

5. Update event command: This command allows the user to update an existing event on a specified calendar.

6. Delete event command: This command allows the user to delete an existing event on a specified calendar.

7. Search events command: This command allows the user to search for events on a specified calendar using specific criteria, such as date range, keyword, or event type.

 8. create event based on gpt prom - tagged events add context of how do it
  
These commands can be implemented using the appropriate methods and endpoints from the Google API Python client library.
